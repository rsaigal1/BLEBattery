# BLEBattery
This was my contribution to the capstone project for my electrical engineering degree.  The project was to create a solar powered phone case to charge the phone.  My role was to create a bluetooth low energy network to communicate batter level information to an application on the phone.  The device (peripheral) will first advertise to the cell phone (central) that it is transmitting batter service information.  The main problem faced during the advertising process was that all devices that are equip with BLE would be able to pick up on data being transmitted from the peripheral device.  To deal with this issue, I created a unique identifier that only our central device would be able to pick up on.  After a connection request is sent from the central device, the batter service data is transmitted using the GATT protocol.
